# owl-css
This is a WIP, minimal style sheet for my blog software.


## Design Decisions

- Only use css classes where pure HTML is not possible.
- No pre-processor or compilation. Pure CSS
- TODO: split stylesheet into base and "extensions". Extensions should serve special purposes, not required by all websites (e.g. the header).


## Devlopment

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open http://localhost:8000
